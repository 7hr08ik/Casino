Noted Bugs and missing features
-------------------------------

- The Dice Game game runs okay without obvious bugs , however there is always room for improvement.
- Bugs that I initially found was the fact that I did not implement a code which will terminate the game in case either parties end up loosing all the money , however this was fortunate because we used this bug to link the game with the lobby.
