Copied basic game structure from lobby
Ball implemented

Plan to implement
    Flippers
    Gravity

10/02

Got gravity working
    constant downwards velocity
    Added bounce capability
Made basic background image to get collisions working
Updated to use png of ball instead of printing circle

25/02
added flipper class, to handle all the roations etc
1st attempt at implementing flippers.
    Attempted to copy the can_move function and add new function for moving the flippers
    Too complex. No need
2nd attempt
    Adding the flippers to the already running ball movement function.
Add additional velocity if hits flippers, and flipper moving
    Created seperate settings for bounce on flippers

28/02
Implemented new method for collision
    Now using a mask on every surface.
    If mask overlaps, then collision
Finally got collision workign with the ball and the flippers
    Ball crawls through flipper rather than bouncing off
    FINALLY got it working
    Needed a full re-write and new functions to get working
        But the ball now returns to previous location before bouncing (to solve the creeping ball)

FUCKING DONE IT!!
Flippers are now rotating correctly around a pivot
Had the wrong idea, i was trying to put the pivot point on the flipper, then atatch the flipper to the board. Wrong way round, the pivot point goes on the board, then the flipper is atatched to it.
